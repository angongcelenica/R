# R
R is an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE) mainly used for statistical data analysis, visualisation and machine learning projects. R has multiple built in library tools to make data cleaning and analysis more simple and convenient.

## Writing a Basic R Program
R has mulitple built-in functions that you can be used for data input/output, structure and variables, the projects below demontsrates the different ways in which you can use them. In order to start creating a basic R program I would need to create a variable that would be assigned to a value which you can continue to build on. I created a basic user input program that required the users name and age. I assigned values to a variable that will generate a list as the output. After creating a sequence of numbers I used built in functions to calculate the mean and sum. I was also able to create a vector of 10 random interger values, these projects show how convenient the built in functions are.

## R & Data Visualisations
This is another example of using built in packages to simplify the data analysis process and in this case I demonstrate how I used 'ggplot2' to create my data visualistaions. It is important to first import the ggplot library in order to activate the packages so the functions can work.
