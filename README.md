R is an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE) mainly used for statistical data analysis, visualisation and machine learning projects. R has multiple ready for use library tools that to make data cleaning and analysis more simple and convenient. Using RStudio I created a few projects to demenstrate the use of functions and variables for calculations.
