# R
R is an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE) mainly used for statistical data analysis, visualisation and machine learning projects. R has multiple built in library tools to make data cleaning and analysis more simple and convenient.

## Writing a Basic R Program
R has mulitple built-in functions that can be used for data input/output, structure and variables, the projects below demontsrate the different ways in which you can use them. In order to create a basic R program I assigned a value to a variable that you can continue to build on. I created a basic user input program that required the users name and age. I assigned values to a variable that will generate a list of pesonal information as the output. After creating a sequence of numbers(20-50, 20-60, 51-91) I used built in functions to calculate the mean and sum. I was also able to create a vector of 10 random interger values with a boolean type, these projects show how convenient the built in functions are. I also created a data frame with some personal information of employees such as their name, age, role, gender and length of service as a way to demonstrate the variety of ways you can use R to create data.

## Using R for Data Visualisations
This is another example of using built in packages to simplify the data analysis and visualisation process and in this case I demonstrated how I used 'ggplot2' to create my data visualisations. It is important to first import the ggplot library in order to activate the packages to enable the use of functions. As you can see I created some data frames, vectors and matrices to build the foundation to start plotting the data on the graph. This enabled me to create a histogram chart to visualise the weekly lateness frequency rates of employees, a scatter plot to show the attendence rates of students once the schools had reopened, lastly a bar chart to visualise the number of used cars sold in 2019 by car make.
